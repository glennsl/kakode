# reasonable-vscode-starter

A very rough starter project for Visual Studio Code extensions written in Reason and BuckleScript.

To get started:

```
git clone http://github.com/glennsl/reasonable-vscode-starter.git
cd reasonable-vscode-starter
npm install
```

Then open the `reasonable-vscode-starter` directory in vscode and launch the extension as you would any other. That's it! The project is set up with a compile task that will run `bsb` in the background and
compile your code on save. Just make a change, then restart the development host as usual to see your changes applied in the Extension Development Host.
